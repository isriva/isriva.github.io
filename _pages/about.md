I am an Applied Math postdoctoral scholar in the [Center for Computational Science and Engineering](https://ccse.lbl.gov/index.html) at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov), where I am developing numerical simulations of stochastic systems that describe complex fluids at the mesoscale. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies](https://cint.lanl.gov) at [Sandia National Labs](https://www.sandia.gov), where I worked with [Gary Grest](https://www.lanl.gov/search-capabilities/profiles/gary-grest.shtml) and Jeremy Lechman on theoretical and computational investigations of soft and granular materials, and with [Scott Roberts](https://www.sandia.gov/~sarober/) on mesoscale simulations of lithium-ion battery electrodes. I received my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) in summer of 2017, where I was advised by [Prof. Tim Fisher](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/tim-fisher/) at the [Birck Nanotechnology Center](https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/birck/index.php).

My current research interests lie at the intersection of soft matter, statistical mechanics and continuum mechanics (solid and fluid mechanics). I am particularly interested in developing theories and computational techniques towards predicting the structure and dynamics of complex fluids, soft materials and granular materials, especially in far-from-equilibrium conditions. Beyond fundamental explorations, my research is often motivated by specific engineering applications such as optimizing electrochemical transport in lithium-ion batteries.
