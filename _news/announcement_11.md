Latest publication in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics after a long yet satisfying peer review! We have developed a tensorial constitutive model for dense granular flows that advances the state-of-the-art in modeling granular materials. Check it out here: [Viscometric flow of dense granular materials under controlled pressure and shear stress](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.811). Here is the [arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04491)
